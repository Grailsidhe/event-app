## About:

This was my second internship project, as I learned VueJs and practiced Typescript. The information is dynamically fetched from JSON files. I also created a component library to aid scaling in the future. The project is intended for clients for the company I created it for and only here as a portfolio item. I don't hold copyright over the images or information displayed, I only wrote the code.

### Tech:

- VueJs
- VuexJs
- Typescript
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
